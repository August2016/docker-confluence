# our confluence service container, using mysql 5.6 as linked in service container.
# you can access the linked db during confluence setup using host "confluence.mysql"
# with user "root", password="secretpassword" and db="confluence" now.

# confluence need's special encoding of your database, unfortunately the entrypoint
# script of official mysql image doesn't support encoding als environment based param.
# you've create your own Dockerfile, extending the officially one and change your mysql
# configuration file by yourself. check your atlassian workbench to see how we've done
# that.
